# Bayesian Predictive Potentials for Inference-Time Alignment of Flow Matching and Diffusion Models

## Abstract

Inference-time reward alignment for flow matching and diffusion models is often framed as sampling from an exponentially tilted target distribution. Feynman--Kac (FK) steering approximates this objective using an interacting particle system that resamples trajectories via intermediate *potentials*. In practice, most formulations rely on *intermediate rewards* (e.g., scoring partially denoised states) and can suffer from weight degeneracy under exponential reweighting. In addition, these approaches can be limited when rewards are only available at the terminal state and are costly to evaluate (e.g., docking or simulators).
We propose *Bayesian Predictive Potentials* (BPP), which use a Bayesian predictor to estimate terminal reward from intermediate prefix states and thereby construct FK potentials, without any intermediate reward evaluations.
Experiments on toy problems and pretrained TABASCO models for molecular generation show promising empirical results.

* Standard non-equivariant Transformer
* Lean and extensible implementation


## Getting Started

**Introduction to Repo:** This repository is based on the [lightning hydra template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template), where you can find an introduction on hydra for pytorch and general usage instructions.

**Downloading datasets:** The processed datasets are available for [GEOM-Drugs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carlosinator/tabasco-geom-drugs) and [QM9](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carlosinator/tabasco-qm9). Move all splits to `src/data` without renaming. Running `src/train.py` for the first time will generate the lmdb dataset, which only happens once and can take about an hour.

**Checkpoints:** We currently provide checkpoints for two models trained on GEOM-Drugs: [TABASCO-mild (3.7M)](https://huggingface.co/carlosinator/tabasco-geom-mild) and [TABASCO-hot (15M)](https://huggingface.co/carlosinator/tabasco-geom-hot). More to follow!

### Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate tabasco
```

### Training

The training configs are available under `configs/experiment`, which overwrite the defaults in the other `configs/*` folders. To train the `TABASCO-hot` model from the paper, you can run:

```python
python src/train.py experiment=hot_geom trainer=gpu
```

**Multi-GPU Training** is available via `torchrun` and trainer parameters are customizable in `configs/trainer`. You may want to pass additional command line arguments to `torchrun` depending on your setup. For example for two GPUs on one node using DDP (assuming a suitable `ddp.yaml` config) you can run

```python
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 --nnodes=1 src/train.py experiment=hot_geom trainer=ddp
```

### Sampling
We provide two scripts for sampling from a model checkpoint, as well as some convenient parameters to modify. Unconditional sampling is called with:

```python
python src/sample.py \
    --num_mols 1000 --num_steps 100 \
    --checkpoint path/to/model.ckpt \
    --output_path path/to/output/folder
```

**Boosting Physical Plausibility**: This is a script for sampling molecules with boosted physical quality (Section 3.5). Where `guidance` encodes the step size of each gradient step, `step-switch` the point at which to switch to UFF bound guidance, and `to-center` whether to regress to the interval center.

```python
python src/sample_uff_bounds.py \
    --guidance 0.01 --step-switch 90 --to-center False \
    --ckpt path/to/model.ckpt --output-dir path/to/output/folder
```

### Model Architecture

The model uses a deliberately simplified non-equivariant Transformer that treats molecular generation as a sequence modeling problem (see the [positional encodings](src/pocketsynth/models/components/positional_encoder.py)). Coordinates and atom types are jointly embedded with time and positional encodings, then processed through standard [Transformer blocks](src/pocketsynth/models/components/transformer.py). No explicit bond information is included and the model relies on generating physically sensible coordinates so that standard chemoinformatics tools can infer bonds reliably. Optional cross-attention layers allow separate processing of coordinate and atom type domains before final MLP heads predict the outputs. The full [model implementation](src/pocketsynth/models/components/transformer_module.py) is easily extensible compared to specialized equivariant architectures.

### Interpolant Class

We combine the required interpolant functionality in one base `Interpolant` class to make the code more readable and extensible. In practice, we found that this significantly increases iteration speed and improves verifiability. The `SDEMetricInterpolant` manages coordinate flows with configurable noise scaling and centering, while `DiscreteInterpolant` handles categorical atom types in the discrete diffusion framework. Each interpolant defines four key operations: noise sampling, path creation between data points, loss computation, and explicit-Euler stepping during generation. This modular design allows mixing different interpolation strategies for different molecular properties while maintaining a unified training loop.
